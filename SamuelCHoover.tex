			      the sequence-specificity of each macromolecule

			      microphase separation transition ($R^{2} > 0.9$), 90x faster than
			      traditional methods

	\section{\sc Research Interests}
	Computational studies (machine learning, simulation, theory) of synthetic and
	biological polymeric systems. One major theme is to elucidate the physical
	mechanisms underpinning protein aggregations and self-assemblies that give
	rise to neurodegeneration. Another theme is to use complex coacervates as
	models for biomolecular condensates to further understand the spatiotemporal
	organization within the cell.
