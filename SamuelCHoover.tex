		{\bf Lab of Prof. Murugappan Muthukumar}\\
		The overarching goal of my current doctoral research is to use simpler
		synthetic analogs to uncover the fundamental physics that govern biological
		self-assemblies like biomolecular condensates ({\bf Project 2}) and protein
		aggregations ({\bf Projects 1 \& 3}). Additionally managed group
		high-performance GPU computing cluster and static HTML webpage.

		separation transition}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Created a >260k row dataset from theoretical calculations and
			      cleaned 3\% using physics-informed filtering
			\item Developed novel molecular modeling method that uniquely captured
			      the sequence-specificity of each macromolecule
			\item Trained a gradient-boosted decision trees model to accurately
			      predict microphase separation transition ($R^{2} > 0.9$)
			\item Quantified the effects of sequence on self-assembly, found
			      second-order salt-dependent interactions on self-assembly using SHAP
			      values

			\item Performed a quantitative assessment of phase stability of complexes
			      with varying molecular structures, chemistries, and solution conditions
			\item Refactored group legacy free energy minimization script to
			      achieve a 10x execution time speedup

			      interaction strengths

	\section{\sc Research Interests}
	Computational studies (machine learning, simulation, theory) of synthetic and
	biological polymeric systems. One major theme is to elucidate the physical
	mechanisms underpinning protein aggregations and self-assemblies that give
	rise to neurodegeneration. Another theme is to use complex coacervates as
	models for biomolecular condensates to further understand the spatiotemporal
	organization within the cell.
